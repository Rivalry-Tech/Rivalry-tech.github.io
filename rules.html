      <h2>Rivalry Charity Challenge Rules</h2>
      <p>The Rivalry! Charity Challenge (the "Charity Challenge") is a competition between two charities using the Rivalry! app to measure the level of support each charity can create in a short time period.  Between February 24, 2015 and March 3, 2015, Rivalry Technologies, LLC ("Rivalry!") will be accepting donations for UGA Miracle and UGA Relay for Life both through the Venmo app (@RivalryApp) and the <a href="http://rivalryapp.com">Rivalry website</a>.  During that week, Rivalry! will track the messaging activity of the charities through our app.  At the conclusion of the UGA basketball game on March 3, 2015, Rivalry! will announce the winner of the challenge.</p>
      <p>Rivalry! will base the winner of the challenge on the number of messages sent by users of the Rivalry! app who have aligned themselves with one of the charities.  The proceeds donated to the Rivalry! charity challenge will then be divided based on the proportion of total activity that each charity generated during the event.  For example, let's say that between the two charities, 10,000 messages get sent - Charity 1 with 5,600 and Charity 2 with 4,400.  Because Charity 1 comprised 56% of the total messages sent during the event, they will be awarded 56% of the proceeds, and the remaining 44% will be awarded to Charity 2.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proceeds go to benefit either UGA Miracle or UGA Relay.  If the total amount raised is greater than $1,000.00, then Rivalry! will keep 5% of the total raise to cover its costs.  If we can't raise that much then we'll just eat those costs.</li>
        <li>Rivalry! is not a non-profit organization itself, so donations to the Charity Challenge will not be tax-deductible.</li>
        <li>Rivalry! is not affiliated with UGA Miracle, UGA Relay for Life, or the University of Georgia.  We just like supporting these charities and we have an app that we think might help with that.</li>
      </ul>
